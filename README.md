# Palak-Rohela_BI_Project
The final project submission of BI on Diabetes Analysis


Objective-:
Predicting that whether the patient has diabetes or not on the basis of the features we will provide to our machine learning model, and for that, we will be using the famous Pima Indians Diabetes Database.

1.Data analysis: Here one will get to know about how the data analysis part is done in a data science life cycle.
2.Exploratory data analysis: EDA is one of the most important steps in the data science project life cycle and here one will need to know that how to make inferences from the visualizations and data analysis.
3.Model building: Here we will be using ML model.
4.Saving model: Saving the best model using pickle to make the prediction from real data.


Data Dictionary-:
The dataset has the following information:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
Age: Age in years
Outcome : Class variable (0: person is not diabetic or 1: person is diabetic)
